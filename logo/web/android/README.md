Icons designed for the android platform, fitting in with the material design standard, and ready to drop into your `app/src/main/res` folder.

Note that TonChan (TurtleCoin Android Wallet) is (as of 2019/07/17) using these icons itself - So you may want to consider using a slightly different logo, to allow the apps to be distinguished.

Want a larger version, or to modify the icon? These icons were generated here: https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html
